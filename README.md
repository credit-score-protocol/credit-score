# Credit Score Protocol

The Credit Score Protocol is a gas-free blockchain protocol designed for next-generation credit and points systems.

## Why CSP?

The Credit Score Protocol is a gas-free blockchain protocol designed for next-generation credit and points systems. It aims to provide users with a secure, transparent, and efficient credit scoring system while ensuring user privacy and data security.

In the real world, assets such as credit scores, points, and memberships are valuable but often undervalued because they are difficult to quantify and trade. The Credit Score Protocol seeks to maximize the value of these assets through blockchain technology, making them quantifiable, tradable, and circulatable.

The Credit Score Network can reassess the value of any real-world asset, build a clear and credible credit system, and transform it into a tradable digital asset, thereby achieving asset circulation and maximizing value.

In the Credit Score Network, users can choose to issue traditional RWA (Real World Asset) tokens, which are no different from any other tokens on the chain and exist in the form of smart contracts. Additionally, the Credit Score Network provides another form of RWA representation (CST), which is natively supported by the Credit Score Protocol and does not require gas fees. Users only need to register on the Credit Score Network to issue CST, without the need for smart contract writing, auditing, deployment, and other operations. It supports exchange with any other CST, tokens, NFTs, and other smart contract tokens, and can be traded on DEX. It naturally supports the tokenization of real-world assets in a friendly manner.
